To convert data in Parquet format to CSV format

One day, I had data in Parquet format that I needed to convert to CSV. Honestly, many people prefer online converters, but I don't find them reliable. With this application, you can turn it into an .exe using PyInstaller and get the job done without dealing with online converters. Simple but useful!
